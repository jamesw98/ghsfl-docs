## Team Organization
### Faculty Sponsor
The Faculty Sponsor is the sole voting representative of the school at GHSFL meetings. As the school Principal's designated representative to the GHSFL, the Faculty Sponsor is recognized by the GHSFL as the team's Head Coach and is the primary point of contact for communication with the member schools. That individual decides on the correct distribution of such comunications within his/her school, team coaches, and parents.   
  
In many schools, there is not an individual knowledgeable in teaching the sport of fencing. For that reason, the Faculty Sponsor usually chooses to contract a non-faculty member as an expert consultant, or "assistant coach". In most cases, these coaches are direct reports of the Faculty Sponsor. Faculty Sponsors should manage the team related activities of all consultant/assistant coaches and parents.   
  
The GHSFL strongly encourages, but does not require, the Faculty Sponsor to be present at every tournament (at some schools, the Principal requires Faculty Sponsors to be present at all club activities). GHSFL does require that every school designate an adult (age 21 years or older) to be responsible for their fencers at each tournament. This individual can be the Faculty Sponsor, coach, or any designated adult. The responsible adultmust have agreed to stay at the tournament while the school has any fencers present. The responsible adult must sign in on the day of the tournament, and schools will not be allowed to participate in the tournament unless this individual is present. The GHSFL strongly recomends that two adults be present.   
  
Faculty Sponsors and coaches must take the appoved on-line concussion safety training course: https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/training/index.html. The Faculty Sponsor is responsible for ensuring the coach(s) for their school has taken the training.   
  
Beginning with the 2020-21 season, GHSFL coaches must be at 21 years of age or older.
