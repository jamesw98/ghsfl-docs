## Team Organization
### Faculty Sponsor
The Faculty Sponsor is the sole voting representative of the school at GHSFL meetings. As the school Principal's designated representative to the GHSFL, the Faculty Sponsor is recognized by the GHSFL as the team's Head Coach and is the primary point of contact for communication with the member schools. That individual decides on the correct distribution of such comunications within his/her school, team coaches, and parents.   
  
In many schools, there is not an individual knowledgeable in teaching the sport of fencing. For that reason, the Faculty Sponsor usually chooses to contract a non-faculty member as an expert consultant, or "assistant coach". In most cases, these coaches are direct reports of the Faculty Sponsor. Faculty Sponsors should manage the team related activities of all consultant/assistant coaches and parents.   
  
The GHSFL strongly encourages, but does not require, the Faculty Sponsor to be present at every tournament (at some schools, the Principal requires Faculty Sponsors to be present at all club activities). GHSFL does require that every school designate an adult (age 21 years or older) to be responsible for their fencers at each tournament. This individual can be the Faculty Sponsor, coach, or any designated adult. The responsible adultmust have agreed to stay at the tournament while the school has any fencers present. The responsible adult must sign in on the day of the tournament, and schools will not be allowed to participate in the tournament unless this individual is present. The GHSFL strongly recomends that two adults be present.   
  
Faculty Sponsors and coaches must take the appoved on-line concussion safety training course: https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/training/index.html. The Faculty Sponsor is responsible for ensuring the coach(s) for their school has taken the training.   
  
Beginning with the 2020-21 season, GHSFL coaches must be at 21 years of age or older.   
  
#### Complaints Against Coahces
Any complaint/report regarding coaches behavior must be made in writing by a faculty-sponsor or team parent. 
* The complaint/report must be sent to the chair or vice-chair of the GHSFL
* The complaint/report must contain the coach's name,the event(s) at which the incident occurred, the date of the event(s), details of the incident and name and contact information of the person(s) making the complaint/report. 
* The GHSFL Board will determine, within two weeks, whether or not suspension from coaching at GHSFL tournaments and/or suspension from attending GHSFL tournaments is warrented while the investigation is ongoing.
* The GHSFL Board will examine the written complaint/report
* The GHSFL Board will contact the accused coach including a copy of the complaint/report
* The contact will include a request for response from the coach that should include any statements from others (including contact information) to support the coach
* Should the coach fail to respond to the request by the GHSFL Board within the time designated (2 weeks), that coach will be banned from attending GHSFL tournaments or coaching at GHSFL tournament for failure to cooperate
* The GHSFL Board will examine all statements. All statements must be sent to the chair or vice chair
* The GHSFL Board will determine whether or not the coach should be banned from coaching and/or attending GHSFL tournaments for the season or a portion of the season on the basis of the evidence gathered
* The coach and the author of the complaint/report will be informed of the Board's decision
* At the conclusion of the season or portion of the season from which a coach is removed, the coach may appeal for reinstatement the following season by submitting a written request to the Board  
  
### Team Member Qualifications
Team membership is limited to students in good standing enrolled in the member school. Members must also meet the following GHSA requirements:
* **Age**: Students must be no moer than 19 years old on May 1 of the current school year. 
* **8 Semesters**: Students are eligible for 8 consecutive semesters beginning with the 1st semester of 9th grade. 
* **Enrollment**: Students must be enrolled full tim at the school they compete for. Full time student means:
  * In regular attendance 
  * Taking courses in the current semester worth at least 2.5 Carnegie Units that count for graduation
* **Previous semester**: Students must have passed (a grade of 70) 2.5 Carnegie Units in the previous semester
  * The courses must be ones that count towards graduation 
  * This rule does not apply to the 1st semester of 9th grade
  * Summer school counts as part of the spring semester
  * "Previous semester" means the previous calendar semester. A student who is not in school in fall is not eligible in spring even if he or she passed 2.5 units the previous spring
* **Previous years in high school**: Students must have passed the following nubers of units in previous years:
  * 2nd year students must have passed at least 5 Carnegie Units in their first year
  * 3rd year students must have passed at least 11 Carnegie Units in their first 2 years
  * 4th year students must have passed at least 17 Carnegie Units in their first 3 years
* **College courses**: Students in Dual Enrollment programs may be eligible and college classes can be counted. Students in Joint Enrollment, Early College or Gateway to College programs may not be eligible. 
* **Credit recovery/make-up work**: Students who make up the required number of units within the first 14 days of a semester through a program available to all students may be eligible
* **Students with disabilities**: Students who are enrolled in a special education program (even if not physically located at the school) may be eligible if they meet their IEP (Individual Education Program) requirements
  
"Carnegie Units" are measurements used by most or all schools. During a semester with a traditional scheudle, a student takes 6 courses with 0.5 units, so passing 2.5 means passing five of the six courses. Students taking a year long course worth 1.0 units with a single grade at the end of the course are considered to have passed 0.5 units in the fall semester if their grade is at least 70 at the start of the spring semester.   
  
## Tournament Hosting
Schools are required to host at least one tournament a season beginning in their third season of competition. Depending on the tournament schedule, schools may be assigned more tha one tournament. If a school finds that it is no longer able to host a tournament it has been assigned, it is that school's responsibility to resolve the situation by hosting at an alternative location (e.g. a middle school or comunity centre), finding another school to host the tournament, or (with the board's approval) moving the tournament to another date.   
  
Tourmanet hosts must provide a first aid kit in the concessions area with visible signage. The tournament manager must be provided with the school's weather safety plan and security plan (e.g. fire, intruder, disturbances, etc.).   
  
For more information about hosting tournaments, see the GHSFL Tournament Hosting Guide.   
  
## Practices and Tournaments
### Team Practices 
* While the Faculty Sponsor is encouraged to attend practices, a responsible adult (age 21 or over) must be present at **all** weapons practices. It is strongly suggested that two adults be present at all practices. 
* The school fencing team must practice together at their school. Member schools may not hold their practices at private fencing clubs. 
* Practices at each member school are limited to students in good standing enrolled in that school
* An individual from a private fencing club may not participate in any member school's practices unless the individual is a member of the school's fencing team and participates in GHSFL tournaments. 
* The school fencing team may not combine their practices with private fencing club practices
* With prior written GHSFL Board approval, member schools may schedule scrimmages with other schools. However, individual students from one school may not participate in another school's practices  

### Tournament Participation
Unless waived by the Board, the school fencing team must meet all tournament facility and strip requirements (referees and equipment) and must provide advance notification of team rosters (tournament participants). A responsible adult must be present for as long as any of the school's fencers are at the tournament.   
  
All schools, including the host, are responsible for providing scoring equipment and referees. For details, see the Competition Format Document.   
  
When a new school joins the GHSFL, it takes time to save money for equipment and train referees. For the first season in which they compete, new schools with less than 15 fencers competing in a tournament will not be assigned any strips but are required to provide one timer/scorekeeper.
