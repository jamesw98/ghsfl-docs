## Getting on the tournament schedule
All schools that have competed in two or more seasons are required to host at least one regular season tournament. The schools that won the previous season's Team Championship have the right of first refusal on hosting the new season's Individual Championship and Team Championship, as well as their obligation to host a regular season tournament. Depending on the number of schools in the league and the number of tournaments in the season, it may be necessary for some schools to host additional tournaments, or for a new school that has not competed in two seasons to host a tournament.   
  
The host receives $10 per fencer from the participating schools. There is also a profit to be made on concessions sales.  
  
The league usually announces tournament dates for the coming season in March and asks schools to bid on hosting the tournaments. Bids are accepted in the order that they are received. Before the schedule is published, try to have an idea of what dates you can host on, that give you the best chance of securing the date(s) you want.   
  
If you are unable to reserve suitable facilities at your school, other possible locations might include a middle or elementary school, a church gym, or a community centre.  
  
The board will assign a host school for tournaments no school has bid on.  
  
## Facilities 
### Fencing Strips
<span style="color:yellow">The GHSFL Tournament Administrator will decide how many strips to assign based on the number of expected fencers from each school. When you host, you will have to send the GHSFL Tournament Administrator maximum number of strips you can accommodate, with the minimum being 8 strips. It is ideal to have more strips, especially for the Individual and Team Championships</span>

### Strip Layout
For most schools, the possible strip locations are: main gym, aux gym, and cafeteria. As a last resort, you can place strips in a wide hallway.  
Fencing strips must be the size specified by USA Fencing: 14m long and 1.5-2m wide. There must be enough space around the strip to allow safe fencing, meaning:
* At least 1.5m run-off space at each end of the strip
* At least .6m (2') between the edge of the strip and the scoring table or any other obstruction
* At least 2m between strips when the space will be occupied by a scoring table
* At least 3.5m between strips when the space will be occupied by two referees
* At least 1.5m between the edge of the strip and a wall when the space will be occupied by one referee  
  
There will also need to be enough room for spectator to get from the doors to their seats and the fencers to move from strip to strip without stepping on a strip or passing between referees and their strips.   
  
It is a good idea to survey possible locations in advance so you know how many strips can be placed in each location.     

### Sample Strip Layout
![Sample Strip Layout](../assets/sample_strip_layout.png)  
  
### Other Space Requirements  
there will usually be one room where most of the strips are, adn where PA announcements will be made. In this document, it will be called "the gym". If you decided to place any of the below tables in the gym, remember that fencers will most likely gather around these tables/spaces, which could eat into strip space. 

#### Check-In Table
You will need a place for the check-in sheets for fencers, referees and school representatives as well as for the people doing equipment checks.   
  
#### Armorers' Table
You should provide a table and chairs for armorers at your event. This is usually place in the gym, since fencers might need quick access to it.   
  
#### Scoring Table
You must provide a table and chairs for the scorers/tournament managers with space for a laptop and printer. This should be in, or close to, the gym. Fencers will be bringing DE slips up to this table.   
  
#### Fencing Bags
You will need to set aside space in or near the gym to store their fencing bags. Do not use the floor of the gym. Upper levels of bleachers, nearby hallways, and classrooms are common spaces to use. It helps to designate spaces for each school with signs for each school's space.   
  
#### Concessions
You will need an area for concessions sales. Most schools have a concessions stand close to the gym that you may be able to use, otherwise, you will need a table and chairs for the volunteers. You also need tables and chairs for the people who are eating.   
  
Most hosts provide breakfast items in the morning and lunch items later in the day.   
  
You must also provide a first aid kit in the concessions area.  
  
#### Referees' Table
You must provide complementary food and drink for the referees, scorekeepers/tournament managers, and coaches. This can be a table in or near the gym and should provide breakfast items, lunch items, and drinks. You can stock the table with items from the concessions stand, or provide referees with vouchers that they can use to get items from the concessions stand.   
  
### Other Facilities Issues
Be familiar with your school's policies and procedures. You should at least know the answer to the following questions:  
What is the procedure for reserving a gym or the cafeteria? Is there a charge?
* How far in advance can facilities be reserved?
* How do you make sure you will have access to other spaces that you plan on using, such as the concessions stand and hallways? That includes hallways you need to get from the school entrance to the gym, etc.
* Do you need to arrange for heating or air conditioning to be turned on (and is there a charge for this)?
* Can you reserve the facilities for the night before the tournament so that you can set up on Friday evening?
* Can bleachers be retracted (if you need more space) and basketball goals be raised (so that épées don’t get caught in the netting)? If so, how do you arrange for this to be done?
* How early in the morning can you get access to the school? Check-in usually opens at 7:30, so you need to
be in the building by 7 AM at the latest (earlier if you didn’t set up on Friday).
* When must you leave? Most tournament finish before 5 PM, but it is best to reserve space until 6 PM.
* How do you get access to the PA system in the gym? What batteries (if any) are needed for the mic?
* Can spectators bring food and drink into the gym (note that fencers must always be allowed water)?
* Where can you get the tables and chairs that you will need? Are you allowed to move them yourselves?
* What other activities will take place on the same day as your tournament? Do they affect what parking lot or school entrance you can use? If there is an ACT or SAT, you may need to keep fencers away from the part of the school where the test is being administered.  
  
### Sample Start Times
<span style="color:yellow">Below is a sample of start times for an event. By no means is this a hard guideline</span>.  
* Referee Meeting: 8:15
* Men's Check-in close: 8:30  
* Women's Check-in close: 10:00  
  
## Communication With Participating Schools
<span style="color:yellow">The Tournament Administrator handles communication between host schools and participating schools up until the night before the tournament<span>
* <span style="color:yellow">The tournament schedule will be sent out at the beginning of the season</span>
* <span style="color:yellow">Hosts are required to send the requested information to the Tournament Administrator no later than 5pm on the Sunday before the event via email</span>  
* <span style="color:yellow">Participating schools are required to submit rosters no later than 5pm on Tuesday before the event</span>  
    * <span style="color:yellow">after this deadline, no new fencers can be added to a school's roster</span>
    * <span style="color:yellow">fencer's can be removed from a roster due to medical exception only</span>
* <span style="color:yellow">The Tournament Administrator will send out the event information as well as strip assignments no later than 5pm on the Wednesday before the event via email</span>
* <span style="color:yellow">Once the Tournament Administrator has imported the rosters into FencingTime, he will send out the results via email to the participating schools</span>
    * <span style="color:yellow">the schools will have 24 hours to notify the Tournament Administrator of any fencers who were on the original rosters sent who are missing from the import results</span>  
    
## Equipment Needed
### Check In
You will need a mask tester, also known as a mask punch. It is a good idea to have two people checking masks.  
    
If you do not have a mask tester, they can be bought from many online retailers such as Absolute Fencing Gear.   
    
You will need some way of marking masks and glove that have passed inspection. The most common way to do this is a stamp. If you do not have a stamp, you can draw/write a distinct mark on the mask and glove. Always be sure that both people checking the masks/gloves have the same stamp and color (or marker).   
    
### Taping Strips
You can speed up this process by creating a template. You can use ~55' of non-stretchy cord and make knots at the distances below. It is recommended that you then mark each knot with something like a baggage tag.  
  * At one end of the cord: the left end of the strip labelled "A"  
  * After 2m: the start of the left warning area labelled "B"
  * After anohter 3m: the left en guarde line labelled "C"
  * After anohter 2m: the center line labelled "D"
  * After another 2m: the right en guarde line labelled "E"
  * After anohter 3m: the start of the right warning area labelled "F"
  * After another 2m: the right end of the strip labelled "G"
  * After another 1.5m: the minimum width of the strip
  * After another 0.5m: the maximum width of the strip  
  
## Scoring Table and Electronics
The tournament manager will need a laptop to run FencingTime and a printer. Be sure to verify before the day of the tournament that the laptop works with the printer <span style="color:yellow">and that FencingTime can run the tournament with no issues.</span> An optional additional computer can be helpful to keep track of what strips are in use.  
  
Schools are to provide an extension cord (50ft is perfect) with two outlets for each strip.   
 
## Other Supplies
Here is a list of things that you will need to buy for each tournament, and things that you are likely to alrady have and just need to bring to the tournament.    
   
### Tape for Strips
Use 1" painter's tape to mark out the strip. If the gym floor is highly polished, you might want to consider using tape designed for delicate surfaces  
    
### Tennis Balls
Not required, but if there is a danger of tables of chair scratching the gym floor, you can put tennis balls on the legs to protect the floor.   
    
### First Aid Kit
Check if your first aid kit needs to be restocked before the tournament  
  
### Check In Table
Have pens available for people to use to check in. Have ink pads and stamps or markers for marking passed equipment.   
    
### Scoring Table
  * Paper
  * Spare ink for printer
  * Tape for posting results 
  * Spare batteries for PA system mic
  * Pencils and sharpener 
  * Clipboards
  * For the team event, have schools bring their own pencils

### Volunteers
<span style="color:yellow">Below is a **suggested** list of volunteer positions. Having some form of signup is recommended</span>
  * Tournament Setup
    * unless you have a very large team, you should plan on having all your fencers assist with tournament setup
    * at least 4 people should help tape strips
  * Concessions 
    * you will need a couple people to setup the concession stand
    * you will also need people to run the stand, this can be the same as the people that set it up, if you want
    * <span style="color:yellow">these people should also stock the referees' table</span>
  * Check In Table
    * you will need at least 2 people to test masks and gloves, but more is always helpful
  * National Anthem
    * a performance of the National Anthem is strongly suggested
    * it should be performed immediately after men's check in closes
  * Clean up
    * you should have all your fencers stay and help clean up the venue after the event has ended  
    
## Fencer Equipment Safety Check
At the check in table, you must perform a safety check on masks and gloves and mark those that pass so that referees can verify.  
    
### Masks
Masks should have no dents in the mesh, broken wires, or sharp edges. The mesh should be tested properly with a mask tester (punch).  
  
<span style="color=yellow">More details about properly testing a mask will be put here. If  mask fails this test write "VOID" in large letters across the bib in permanent marker. If a fencer presents a mask with "VOID" or similar written on the bib, do not accept it.</span>   
The mask must have two points of contact with the back of the head, masks with no tongue and only two straps in an "X" should be rejected.   
    
The integrity of the mask's elastic strap should be tested to ensure that the strap(s) stretches, that the elastic has not been worn out and that the elastic is in satisfactory condition. When stretching the elastic, if there is no stretch or if it is too loose, reject the mask.   
    
Foil and sabre masks are not allowed for GHSFL competition.   
    
### Gloves
Gloves with manufactured holes for body cords may be used. Gloves which have rips, tears, or holes in the upper layer of material may not be used.   
    
### Information Included in Other Documents
Each school will have access to this site wich contains the following documents which are useful in running a tournament:
  * *GHSFL FencingTime Instructions*: how to run a tournament in FencingTime
  * *Competition Format*: describes the GHSFL tournament season 
  
You should be familiar with these documents before running a tournament for the GHSFL.   
    
## Medal Ceremony
As soon as the last bout is over, you should award medals to the top four fencers in each event. The league will provide medals. 
Suggested announcement: "The top four fencers should assemble for the mdeal ceremony wearing full white or their high school fencing team jacket"  
    
Suggested medal ceremony announcement:  
"Tied for third place, in no particular order, the bronze medal goes to: [fencer] from [school] and [fencer] from [school]. In second place, the silver medal goes to [fencer] from [school]. In first place, the gold medal goes to [fencer] from [school]"  
Pause between each to give out the medal.   
Allow time for parents, coaches, etc to take pictures of the medal winners.   
    
## Signage, Forms, and Notes  
  
### Signs outside the school
Have signs directing visitors from the campus entrance to where they should park, and from the parking lot to the school entrace they should use. These signs should be readable from a distance. "Fencing" in large letters with an arrow works perfectly.   
    
### Signs Inside the School
The resources and forms page on this site has a set of signs that you might find useful.   
    
#### Tournament Signs
This set of signs includes:
  * First aid
  * Various tables
    * sign in
    * mask check
    * etc
  * Directing people to the tournament 
  * Directing people to strips in other rooms
  
#### Results Signs
This set includes headers to identify the results posted on the wall  
  
#### School Signs
For this, you can simply print the name of the school in a large font on a piece of paper. This is useful to show schools where their fencers' bags need to go  
    
#### Strip Numbers  
These signs are just numbers 1 - the max number of strips at your venue  
    
### GHSFL Medical Withdrawal form  
The resources and forms page on this site also contains the Medical Withdrawal form. You should print a couple copies for your tournament. Any completed forms should be given to the GHSFL Vice Chair after the tournament  
    
### Referee Meeting Notes
The referee meeting is conducted by the Bout Committee Chair, who is usually the head coach of the host school. The GHSFL Vice Chair will provide notes on point to be covered in th emeeting. If your head coach will not be at the referee meeting, you must inform the Vice Chair so that anothe rhead coach can be assigned.   
    
## Timeline
