# Roster Submission Guidelines
* Rosters must use the template file sent out in emails by the GHSFL Tournament Coordinator
* Do not add any additional columns or formatting to the template
* Do not have any blank rows in the roster
* Follow this filename convention: rX_schoolname_gender.xlsx
  * X should be replaced with the round number
  * gender is either "male" or "female"
  * there should be no spaces in the filename
* **DO NOT send your rosters in a reply to an email, send your rosters in a new email with the subject "Roster Round X - schoolname" where X is the round number. If you send your rosters in a reply, it is very hard to find them.**
