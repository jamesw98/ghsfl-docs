# Non-Combativity Rule  
The GHSFL uses an older version of non-combativity instead of the current USA Fencing passivity rules. The non-combativity rule is as follows:
* Non-combativity 1 minute without a touch or halt or 15 seconds of no clear intention to fence, immediately call halt and move to the next period with no break.
* If non-combativity occurs in the 3rd period, call halt, and determine priority. **Priority will only come into play if the score is tied at the end of one minute.** Fencers will then immediately move to a 1 minute period of fencing. If, at the end of this 1 minute period, the score is tied, the fencer who was awarded priority **at the beginning of this 1 minute period** is declared the winner of the bout.
