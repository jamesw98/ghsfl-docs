## Getting on the tournament schedule
All schools that have competed in two or more seasons are required to host at least one regular season tournament. The schools that won the previous season's Team Championship have the right of first refusal on hosting the new season's Individual Championship and Team Championship, as well as their obligation to host a regular season tournament. Depending on the number of schools in the league and the number of tournaments in the season, it may be necessary for some schools to host additional tournaments, or for a new school that has not competed in two seasons to host a tournament.   
  
The host receives $10 per fencer from the participating schools. There is also a profit to be made on concessions sales.  
  
The league usually announces tournament dates for the coming season in March and asks schools to bid on hosting the tournaments. Bids are accepted in the order that they are received. Before the schedule is published, try to have an idea of what dates you can host on, that give you the best chance of securing the date(s) you want.   
  
If you are unable to reserve suitable facilities at your school, other possible locations might include a middle or elementary school, a church gym, or a community centre.  
  
The board will assign a host school for tournaments no school has bid on.  
  
## Facilities 
### Fencing Strips
The GHSFL Tournament Administrator will decide how many strips to assign based on the number of expected fencers from each school. When you host, you will have to send the GHSFL Tournament Administrator maximum number of strips you can accommodate, with the minimum being 8 strips. It is ideal to have more strips, especially for the Individual and Team Championships  

### Strip Layout
Most schools, the possible strip locations are: main gym, aux gym, and cafeteria. As a last resort, you can place strips in a wide hallway.  
Fencing strips must be the size specified by USA Fencing: 14m long and 1.5-2m wide. There must be enough space around the strip to allow safe fencing, meaning:
* At least 1.5m run-off space at each end of the strip
* At least .6m (2') between the edge of the strip and the scoring table or any other obstruction
* At least 2m between strips when the space will be occupied by a scoring table
* At least 3.5m between strips when the space will be occupied by two referees
* At least 1.5m between the edge of the strip and a wall when the space will be occupied by one referee  
  
There will also need to be enough room for spectator to get from the doors to their seats and the fencers to move from strip to strip without stepping on a strip or passing between referees and their strips.   
  
It is a good idea to survey possible locations in advance so you know how many strips can be placed in each location.
